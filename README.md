# 3Dprints
Collection of both settings and files

Currently have this set up for both my printers that I'm currently running.
  I've got an Ender 5 Plus and and an Elegoo Saturn S
    Slicer of choice for FDM is PrusaSlicer and for resin is Lychee
    
I will also post photos of how the objects print with specific setting pertaining to height, exposure setting, speed and quality.
  Keep an eye out if I update things
    I'll also post how I have my Marlin set up, what parameters, board, screen, and mods done to machine
    
You're free to try things out and let me know how it worked out for you.
